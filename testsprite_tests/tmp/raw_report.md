- **Test Error:** The quiz game was successfully started in random mode and multiple questions were observed. The questions appeared in a non-deterministic order as expected for random mode. The game was then ended and the system navigated to the sequential mode selection screen, ready for a sequential mode test to compare question order. Since the sequential mode test was not performed yet, the task to fully verify non-deterministic question delivery is not fully complete.

#### Test TC011
- **Test Name:** Player receives questions in real-time and submits answers
- **Test Code:** [TC011_Player_receives_questions_in_real_time_and_submits_answers.py](./TC011_Player_receives_questions_in_real_time_and_submits_answers.py)
- **Test Error:** The quiz application was tested through the full flow: admin login, question management, quiz hosting, and player interface navigation. The quiz game started successfully on the server side with players connected. However, on the player side, no players joined the game, preventing the game from starting and thus real-time question reception and answer submission could not be verified. Therefore, the core task of confirming that players receive quiz questions instantly via Socket.IO events, can select answer choices, and submit them successfully remains unconfirmed. Further testing requires simulating or connecting actual players to join the game and participate in the quiz. Task is not fully finished.

No appropriate message about late submission was shown. Therefore, the requirement that late submissions should be rejected and notified is not met.
